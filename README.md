### Steps to run the project:

1. Clone this Git repository
2. Download and import the Postman collection from [here](https://github.com/ThatSalbert/PAD_LabWorks/blob/main/Resources/Postman/Weather%20API.postman_collection.json) which has all the needed requests and the request bodies are already set up (you just need to change the values of  the parameters)
3. Build and run the project with `docker-compose` 
    **! NOTE**: When building and running the project, it will take some time for the database to initialise, to create the database and to import the data from the SQL file.
4. Run the requests from the Postman collection which can be found in `Weather API >> Gateway Module`
